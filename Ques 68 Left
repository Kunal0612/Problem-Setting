Create a C++ function named ArrayBeauty to find the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly k

Let's call beauty of an array b1,b2,…,bn (n>1)  — min1≤i<j≤n|bi−bj|.

You're given an array nums[1],nums[2],…nums[n] and a number limit. Calculate the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly limit. As this number can be very large, output it modulo 998244353.

A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input:

The vector of integers nums.
The integer limit.

Constraints:

limit : ranges from 1 to nums.size()
nums.size() : ranges from nums.size() to 1000.
nums : ranges from 0 to 100000.


Output:

An integer answer the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly limit.
