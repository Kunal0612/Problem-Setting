Create a C++ function named XORCounting to find the answer that contain sum of all possible values of a[1]⨁a[2]⨁…⨁a[len] 
among all non-negative integers a[1],a[2],…,a[len] with a[1]+a[2]+…+a[len]=sum.
As the answer may be too large, output your answer modulo 998244353.

Given two positive integers sum and len. Find the sum of all possible values of a[1]⨁a[2]⨁…⨁a[len], where a[1],a[2],…,a[len] 
are non-negative integers such that a[1]+a[2]+…+a[len]=sum.

Note that all possible values a[1]⨁a[2]⨁…⨁a[len] should be counted in the sum exactly once.

As the answer may be too large, output your answer modulo 998244353.

Input:

An integer sum.
An integer len.

Constraints:

sum : ranges from 0 to 10^18.
len : ranges from 1 to 10^5.

Output:

An integer answer that contain sum of all possible values of a[1]⨁a[2]⨁…⨁a[len] among all non-negative integers a[1],a[2],…,a[len] with a[1]+a[2]+…+a[len]=sum.
As the answer may be too large, output your answer modulo 998244353.
