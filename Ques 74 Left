Create a C++ function named Prediction GoodPairs to find the number of good pairs.

You are given an array a consisting of n integers and an integer val.

A pair (l,r) is good if there exists a sequence of indices i1,i2,…,im such that 

-> i1=l and im=r 

-> ij<ij+1 for all 1≤j<m and |aij−aij+1|≤k for all 1≤j<m.

Find the number of pairs (l,r) (1≤l≤r≤n) that are good.

Input:

A vector of integers nums.
An integer val.

Constraints:

val : ranges from 0 to 10^5.
nums.size() : ranges from 1 to 500000.
nums : ranges from 1 to 100000.

Output:

An integer answer that contain the number of good pairs.
