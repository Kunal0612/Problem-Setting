Create a C++ function named AnotherMinimization to find an integer answer the minimum possible total cost of resulting subsegments. 

You are given an array of n integers. The cost of a subsegment is defined as the number of unordered pairs of distinct indices within the subsegment that contain equal elements. Your task is to split the array into k non-intersecting, non-empty subsegments such that the sum of their costs is minimized. Each element of the array must be present in exactly one subsegment.

Input:

An integer split the number of segments you need to split the array into.
The vector of integers nums.

Constraints:

nums.size() : ranges from 2 to 100000.
nums : ranges from 1 to nums.size().
split : ranges from 2 to min(2,nums.size()).


Output:

An integer answer the minimum possible total cost of resulting subsegments.
